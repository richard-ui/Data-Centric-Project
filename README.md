## Brief Introduction to the Project

The purpose of this project is to create a virtual recipe website that uses a database of recipes which can be 
searched, viewed, added, deleted and updated.

## UX User Stories

### First Time User's:

- As a First Time user, I want to understand the main concept of the site and learn the intention of its relevance.

- As a First time user, I want to be able to navigate the site in an easy and efficient way without any complex design.

- As a First Time user, I want to be able to browse and search for recipes 

- As a First Time user, I want to get inspiration for a recipe to make myself.

### Returning User's:

- As a returning user, I want to be able to log in easily and efficiently. 

- As a returning user, I want to be able to view my recipes on my own profile page. 

- As a returning user, I want to be able to edit and delete my recipes on the same page.

- As a returning user, I want to be able to add new recipes 

- As a returning user I want to be able to search a recipe from an input box and see suggestions depending on which letters I type. 

### Admin goals: 

- As an Admin, I want recipes added via the site to be stored in the correct format in the database 

- As an Admin, I want to be able to see who has added each recipe. 

## Design

1. Colour Scheme
- The two main colours on the site are bright, creating a vibrant feeling for the user throughout. Using dark font for headings/links contrasted nicely with the flow of the page.

2. Typography
- The 'Verdana' font is the main font used throughout the website with Times and Serif as the fallback fonts in case for any reason the font is not supported by the browser.

## Testing

### User Testing for User Stories
### First Time User's:

- As a First Time user, I want to understand the main concept of the site and learn the intention of its relevance.

  i. Upon entering the site, it is clear to the user that the website is about food, due to the sites vibrant colours and clear
  background image of food displayed on the body.
  
  ii. These links are also dynamic as specific links will be shown depending on whether the user is logged in or not.

- As a First time user, I want to be able to navigate the site in an easy and efficient way without any complex design.

  i. The navigation is clear and bright using bold text for the linksto identify each.
  
  ii. These links are also dynamic as specific links will be shown depending on whether the user is logged in or not.

- As a First Time user, I want to be able to browse and search for recipes.

  i. A card is displayed on the homepage allowing me to type in a recipe and click the seasrch button beside it.
  Recipes will display below.
  
  ii. If no recipes are found a "No results found" message will warn the user immediately.

- As a First Time user, I want to get inspiration for a recipe to make myself.

  i. The images have an effect on what food the user may desire
  
  ii. The Cuisines list in the dropdown provide nationalities, as they view them, they can think of recipes from one of these Countrie's.
