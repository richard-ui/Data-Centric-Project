## Brief Introduction to the Project

The purpose of this project is to create a virtual recipe website that uses a database of recipes which can be 
searched, viewed, added, deleted and updated.

## UX User Stories

### First Time User's:

- As a First Time user, I want to understand the main concept of the site and learn the intention of its relevance.

- As a First time user, I want to be able to navigate the site in an easy and efficient way without any complex design.

- As a First Time user, I want to be able to browse and search for recipes 

- As a First Time user, I want to get inspiration for a recipe to make myself.

### Returning User's:

- As a returning user, I want to be able to log in easily and efficiently. 

- As a returning user, I want to be able to view my recipes on my own profile page. 

- As a returning user, I want to be able to edit and delete my recipes on the same page.

- As a returning user, I want to be able to add new recipes 

- As a returning user I want to be able to search a recipe from an input box and see suggestions depending on which letters I type. 

### Admin goals: 

- As an Admin, I want recipes added via the site to be stored in the correct format in the database 

- As an Admin, I want to be able to see who has added each recipe. 

## Design

1. Colour Scheme
- The two main colours used on the site are dark blue and white. Using a dark and white color together contrasted nicely with the flow of the page.

2. Typography
- The 'Epilogue' font is the main font used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font is not supported by the browser.

3. Google Fonts:

4. Font Awesome:
- Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.
5. jQuery:
- jQuery is a feature of bootstrap to make the navbar responsive in Javascript.
6. Git
